# Local Dev with Lando
This was my demo code repository for Laracon Online on Feb 9, 2022. 

## Setup
* Install the latest version of [Lando](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases/latest)
* Optionally (but recommended), [trust the Lando CA](https://docs.lando.dev/config/security.html#trusting-the-ca)
* `lando start`
* The app is now accessible on https://laracon.lndo.site
